[Quotes.md](https://quotes-md.vercel.app/) is designed to bridge the gap between the notes you take in Google Play Books and your personal knowledge management system, like Obsidian. By automating the process of extracting, organizing, and formatting your highlighted quotes into Markdown files, quotes.md helps streamline the integration of your reading insights into your workflow, making it easier to reference and build upon them later.
